# Professional-Portfolio

This is my updated online resume/portfolio. I have updated it with more customization to better reflect myself, as well as highlight my favorite projects I have created or participated in as a group. If you have any questions or would like to contact me, please use the 'Contact' link on my website.

## Getting Started
To visit my site, open the link https://valeriemiller5.github.io/Professional-Portfolio/. Navigation buttons have been added to the top left-hand side of the page.

## Prerequisites
Google Chrome is recommended for running this program.

## Challenges
This is the first time I've used a css library that wasn't Bootstrap.  this time I used Foundation - while it took time to get used to, this library seems to be less restrictive than Bootstrap and easier to use.  One of the setbacks, though, is that the main library information requested coders to download the library or use SASS. It took a little hunting to find the Foundation CDN...

Other challenges included adding css mobile resonsiveness to the already created responsive code created by Foundation.

## Built With
* jQuery - to create the actions of the game
* CSS/Foundation - visuals for the webpage
* Firebase - database used to store information sent by users through the contact form
